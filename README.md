# Order Analysis Dashboard

This Power BI dashboard provides insights into order patterns, sales performance, and item popularity based on order and menu data.  It allows for interactive exploration of the data through slicers and visualizations.

## Dataset

The dashboard utilizes two datasets:

* **`order_details`:** Contains information about individual orders, including order date, time, item ID, and order ID.  *(Note: This dataset does not include price or quantity.  Calculations assume each item ID represents one unit.)*
* **`menu_items`:** Contains details about menu items, including item name, category, and price.

The two datasets are related via the `item_id` (or `menu_item_id`) column.

## Key Metrics and Visualizations

The dashboard calculates and visualizes the following key metrics:

* **Total Revenue:** Calculated using the `RELATED` function to link the `order_details` and `menu_items` tables and sum the prices. *(Assumes each item ID represents one unit sold.)*
* **Revenue by Item:** Calculated by iterating through the `order_details` table and multiplying the price of each item (retrieved using the `RELATED` function) by the assumed quantity of 1.
* **Orders by Hour:** Counts the number of orders placed during each hour of the day.
* **Orders by Day of Week:** Counts the number of orders placed on each day of the week.
* **Average Order Value by Hour:** Calculates the average value of orders placed during each hour of the day.
* **Top 10 Best-Selling Items:**  Identifies the 10 items with the highest revenue.

The dashboard includes the following visualizations:

* **Sales Trend over Time (Line Chart):** Shows total revenue trends over a selected time period.
* **Revenue by Category (Bar Chart):** Compares revenue generated by different menu item categories.
* **Item Performance (Bar Chart):** Displays the revenue generated by each individual menu item.
* **Order Count by Hour of Day (Bar Chart):**  Illustrates order volume throughout the day.
* **Order Count by Day of Week (Bar Chart):** Shows order volume for each day of the week.
* **Average Order Value by Hour (Line Chart):** Visualizes the average order value across different hours.
* **Top 10 Best-Selling Items (Bar Chart):** Highlights the top performing menu items.
* **Category Performance (Pie Chart):** Shows the hierarchical relationship between categories and items, visualizing revenue contribution.

## Interactive Elements

* **Month Slicer:** Allows users to filter the data and visualizations by a specific month.
